Description: As different antipsychotic medications have different potencies,
    the doses of different medications cannot be directly compared. Various
    strategies are used to convert doses into a common reference so that
    comparison is meaningful. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) has historically been used
    as a reference medication into which other antipsychotic doses can be
    converted, as "chlorpromazine-equivalent doses". Using conversion keys
    generated from widely-cited scientific papers (Gardner et. al 2010
    <https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09060802>, Leucht et al. 2016
    <https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbv167>), antipsychotic doses are converted
    to CPZ (or any specified antipsychotic) equivalents. The use of the package
    is described in the included vignette. Not for clinical use.
